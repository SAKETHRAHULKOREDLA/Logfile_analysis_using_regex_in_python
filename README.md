This Python code analyzes a system log file named "syslog.log" and generates two CSV (comma-separated values) files:
one is error_message.csv which consists of the unique error messages that have appeared in the log with their respective count
the other is the user_statistics.csv which includes the statistics for each user in the log file, including the total number of INFO and ERROR messages associated with that user
